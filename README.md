# Roseraie
Roseraie is a website that allows users to view photographs of different rose varieties along with related information. It also offers filtered search functionality and color extraction. Users can upload images or add new rose varieties to the site.


## Techs used
I coded this project using Javascript, PHP, SQL, HTML and CSS.

No specific modules need to be installed.


## Usage
The website consists of 5 different pages : 
* **accueil.html*** - The main page of the website.
* **about.html** - A page presenting the website's use and motives.
* **roses.php** - The main page of the project. The user can scroll a gallery of rose photograpies, and read their information by clicking on any of them. The user can also filter these phootographies, either by the flower's color, or by its variety. By choosing one of the roses, the user can select it for color extraction which loads another page.
* **couleurs.php** - A page that loads when the user selects a specific photography from the roses.php page. It includes tools for color extraction by clicking on any pixel of the image, and displaying the color choosed and its hexcode side by side.
* **ajout.php** - This page allows the user to upload an image by completing a form, specifying information like the variety, color, height and number of petals of the rose.
